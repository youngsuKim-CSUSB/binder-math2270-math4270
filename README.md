There are a few ways you run ``SageMath`` on ``JupyterLab``.

`sagemath-activity-dsolve.ipynb` contains a demo of using the `desolve` package (function).

* [SageCell](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/): This webpage lets you to execute one cell each time. 
* Use [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/youngsuKim-CSUSB/binder-math2270-math4270.git/HEAD?labpath=.%2Fsagemath-activity-dsolve.ipynb). To launch it, click on the ``launch binder`` icon. no installation is necessary but it may take a while to load. 
* Use the school server, https://csusb-jupyter.nrp-nautilus.io/. You still need to download and upload the ``.ipynb`` file. 
    > **Wanrning:** No work will be saved once you lose your connection to the Binder server. If you are inactive for some minutes (I guess around 10 minutes), you will lose your connection meaning your work. 
* Download the ``.ipynb`` file to your computer and work locally. This only works if you have SageMath installed on your local machine; see below how to download a file. 

When done you copy and paste your code to [Gradescope]().
